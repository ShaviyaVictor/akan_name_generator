# AKAN NAME GENERATOR
# Project Description
The project is all about building *a web application that takes a user's **birthday** and **calculates the day of the week they were born** and then depending on their gender **outputs their Akan Name***.    
Whereby, Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.    
The application will check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one.    
The application will output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender.
